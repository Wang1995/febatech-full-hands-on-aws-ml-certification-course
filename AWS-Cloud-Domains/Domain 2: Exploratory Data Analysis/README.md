# Abstract

* Data preprocessing is a crucial step for a Machine Learning Problem. Its all about the data.
* In this domain you will learn about the techniques involved in Data Analysis so that you could choose your future path well.

# Directions

* We first present you with all the concepts requires in the form of a **Notebook**. It also contains hands on videos to get an expreience and grip on the concepts.
* You are required to read them one by one following with the respected video.
* There is a solved Real world example from kaggle competetions.You can go and solve by using the techniques you have learnt along with the well documented notebook we have provided which contains detailed code and concept explanation.
