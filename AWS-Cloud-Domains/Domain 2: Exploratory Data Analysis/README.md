# Abstract

* Data preprocessing is a crucial step for a Machine Learning Problem. Its all about the data.
* In this domain you will learn about the techniques involved in Exploratory Data Analysis so that you could choose your future path well.

# Directions

* We first present you with all the concepts requires in the form of a **Jupyter Notebook**. It also contains hands on videos to get an expreience and grip on the concepts.
* You are required to read them in sequence along with the respected video.
* There is a Real world example from kaggle competetions.You can see the Exploratory Data Analysis part of the problem in the given notebook.It contains well documented notebook we have provided which contains detailed code and concept explanation.
