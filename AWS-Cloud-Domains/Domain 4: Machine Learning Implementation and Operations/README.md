# Abstract

* This section is the most exciting and fun part where we train and deploy our models.
* SageMaker provides various tools that simplifies our deployment work. We will see, how to train a built model and deploy it in sagemaker.

# Content

* Model in the form of a python script file.
* SageMaker Notebook which drives the entire process of extracting,training and deploying models.
* A handson video to show everything.

# Directions

* You need to follow the video, that shows detailed steps of extracting data from S3, importing model from script file, training and deploying.
